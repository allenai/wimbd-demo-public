# WIMBD Demo


This demo is accompanying the `wimbd` project.
You can find the code [here](https://github.com/allenai/wimbd), and the paper [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RvfPnOkPV4).

This demo showcase a few of the artifacts we extracted from 10 different large-scale text corpora.
Each component is interactive, and meant to serve as an easy way of exploring the data.

The data and artifacts created by this project can be found on gcp: `gs://wimbd`.
The specific files used for the demo can be found on the skiff machine: `skiff-files-writer:/skiff_files/apps/wimbd/` (more specific commands can be found below).

For questions, please refer to yanaiela@allenai.org

## Important
Due to licencing restrictions, we could not release the library with the psycogp library which we use to query the DB where
we store the internet doamin information.
For this reason, if you'd like to make this library run correctly, please follow the following steps:

1. Add to the [requirements.txt](api/requirements.txt) the psycogp library in a separate line: `psycopg[binary,pool]==3.1.9`
2. Follow the rest of the instructions in this readme to run the code.


To get started with local development, you want to download the files used in the app.
For this you want to make sure that you are able to connect to skiff-files:
```bash
gcloud compute ssh --zone "us-west1-b" --project "ai2-reviz" "skiff-files-writer" --internal-ip
```

Then, create the local directory where these files would be located. You should create such files yourself, or get them [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/wimbd)
```bash
mkdir skiff_files
# Get relevant files
```


Ahoy! Welcome to your new [skiff](https://github.com/allenai/skiff) template
application that includes:

* A Python, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) API server.
* A [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
  and [Varnish](http://github.com/allenai/varnish-mui) based user interface.
* An [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) web server for serving static assets and
  reverse proxying requests to the API.
* Automatic deploys to shared infrastructure and other functionality provided by
  [skiff](https://skiff.allenai.org).

To start a new repository from this template, click [here](https://github.com/allenai/skiff-template/generate).

## Prerequisites

Before following the steps below, make sure that you have the latest version
of [Docker 🐳](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your local
machine.

## Getting Started

Start by opening `skiff.json` and updating the `appName`, `contact` and
`team` fields:

* The `appName` field should be a short, unique and url-safe identifier for
  your application. This value determines the url of your application, which
  will be `${appName}.apps.allenai.org`.
* The `contact` field should be the `@allenai.org` email address that is
  responsible for the demo. Don't include the `@allenai.org` bit,
  just the part before it.
* The `team` field is the name of the team at AI2 that's responsible for
  the demo.

After commiting and pushing these changes make sure to submit a
[request to be onboarded](https://github.com/allenai/skiff/issues/new/choose).

To start a version of the application locally for development purposes, run
this command:

```
~ docker compose up --build
```

This process launches several processes. When things have finished starting,
you'll see a message from a program called `sonar` informing you of the URL your
local environment is accessible at.


It might take a minute or two for your application to start, particularly
if it's the first time you've executed this command.

As you make changes the running application will be automatically updated.
Sometimes the changes will be applied without refreshing, and other times you'll
just need to refresh the page in your browser to see your updates.

Sometimes one portion of your application will crash. When this occurs resolve
the cause and re-run `docker compose up --build` to start things back up.

## Installing Third Party Packages

You'll likely want to install third party packages at some point. To do so
follow the steps described below.

### Python Dependencies

To add new dependencies to the Python portion of the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your local environment is running (i.e. you've ran `docker compose up`).
1. Start a shell session in the server container:
    ```
    ~ docker compose exec api /bin/bash
    ```
1. Install the dependency in question:
    ```
    ~ python -m pip install <dependency>
    ```
1. Update the dependency manifest:
    ```
    ~ python -m pip freeze -l > requirements.txt
    ```
1. Exit the container:
    ```
    ~ exit
    ```

Remember to commit and push the `requirements.txt` file to apply your changes.

### UI Dependencies

To add new dependencies to the UI, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your local environment is running (i.e. you've ran `docker compose up`).
1. Start a shell session in the ui container:
    ```
    ~ docker compose exec ui /bin/sh
    ```
1. Install the dependency in question:
    ```
    ~ yarn add <dependency>
    ```
1. Exit the container:
    ```
    ~ exit
    ```

Remember to commit and push both the `yarn.lock` and `package.json` files
to apply your changes.

## Deploying

Your changes will be deployed automatically after they're pushed to the `main`
branch. To see information about your application and what's deployed,
visit the [Skiff Marina](https://marina.apps.allenai.org).

If you'd like to deploy a temporary, ad hoc environment to preview your changes,
view [this documentation](https://skiff.allenai.org/marina.html#creating-a-new-environment).

## Metrics and Logs

Skiff applications capture two kinds of metrics:

- Service level metrics, which capture information about the number of requests
  made to your application, the response rate, and other operational metrics.
  There's more information about these metrics [here](https://skiff.allenai.org/marina.html#service-level-metrics).

- End user analytics, which use JavaScript to track how many end users load
  your site in a Browser. There's more information about these statistics
  [here](https://skiff.allenai.org/stats.html).
